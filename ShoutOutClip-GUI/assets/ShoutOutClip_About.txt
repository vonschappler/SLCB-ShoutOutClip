# Overview:

    1. Used programming languages and frameworks:

        + Main script:
            - Python 2.7.13

        + Graphical User Interface (GUI):
            - Python 2.7.13
            - Tkinter (python framework for GUI design)
        
    2. Requirements:

        + StreamlabsChatbot 1.02.78 (or above)
        
        + Python 2.7.13

        + Operational System(s):
            - Windows 10 (or above)
        
        + Streaming platform:
            - Twitch (100% tested)
        
    3. Basic funcionalities:

        + Enables automatic shoutouts with custom messages sent in chat for saved streamers
        
        + Displays a customizable overlay (colors and typography / font) with the streamer shouted

        + Displays a random clip of the shouted streamer if the related option is enabled

        + Displays basic information of the clip played (clip title and game played when the clip was saved) if the related option is enabled
        
        + Uses sqlite database model to manage the streamers to be shout with custom messages

        + Ueses a queue for consecutive shouts instead of a command cooldown
        
        + Provides a group of commands to be used with the script

    4. To do in future patches:

        + Fix chat commands, when and if necessary. For the moment, those messages are sent only on stream chat, due to Twitch IRC
          chat deprecation. It would be optimal if some message could be send as whispers, in order to prevent chat spam
          with "unwanted/unnecessary" messages.

        + Fix overlay breakups (if possible) due to some CORS policies imposed by OBS over browser sources (aka overlays) when
          playing clips.

        + Fix typos when found, or as by request of the script users.

# Known issues/extra notes:

    Below there is a list of known issues. Some of those isses are not script related and cannot be fixed.
    Future patches of this script and dashboard application will provide fixes to issues realated ONLY to
    script coding.

    + As stated previously, due to some CORS policies imposed by OBS over browser sources (overlays), the clip may not play correctly,
      get stuck at a certain point or even have the played sound distorted - there is not much to be done on this matter, so the only
      fix to this is done by the user by refreshing the source and interacting with it inside OBS.

    + Due to Twitch IRC chat deprecation, some of the used  IRC chat commands used may not work. If that happens, please notify the
      developer, so a possible fix for this can be done, via replacement of the Twitch command used to a different one - if applicable.

    + It can happen that one or more commands may not work. If this happens, please renew your tokens (streamer and bot) within
       chatbot. Remember those tokens are valid for 30 days, so it's advised to renew them at least once per month inside the chatbot.

    + Clicking inside the Quick help text instead of clicking in the scrollbar next to it, may cause its internal contents to change into a
       message informing that a quick help for it was not found. This can be reverted back to it's normal by pressing "Tab" to select a
       different GUI element and rever the text to the selected element quick help information. This sadly, due to computational
       limitations, can't be fixed (YET).
